 * repeated the same member+role lookup. On the leads page that was 12 of the
 * ~20 requests in the waterfall, ~1s apiece. `GET /workspace/:id/capabilities`
 * now evaluates the whole map server-side in one request, and both sides read
 * the bundle definitions from here so the endpoint and the UI cannot disagree
